CSS Animation by Building a Ferris Wheel - README
Project Overview
This project is part of a course focused on learning CSS animations by creating a visually appealing Ferris wheel. You'll use CSS to animate a Ferris wheel, making it rotate and bringing life to a static web page. This project helps you understand how CSS animations work, including keyframes, timing functions, and how to apply these concepts to create smooth, continuous motion.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a rotating Ferris wheel using HTML and CSS. Through this project, you will learn how to create and control animations in CSS, including rotation, timing, and easing functions.

Project Features
Ferris Wheel Structure:

Construct the Ferris wheel using basic HTML elements like div and span. These elements will represent the wheel, spokes, and cabins.
Apply CSS to style the Ferris wheel, giving it a realistic look with colors, shapes, and positioning.
CSS Animations:

Use CSS @keyframes to define the rotation of the Ferris wheel. Learn how to make the animation smooth and continuous.
Apply the animation property to the Ferris wheel element, specifying the duration, timing function, and iteration count.
Timing and Easing:

Experiment with different timing functions (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out) to control the speed and smoothness of the animation.
Set the animation to loop indefinitely, creating the effect of a constantly rotating Ferris wheel.
Adding Details:

Add cabins to the Ferris wheel using additional HTML elements. Position them evenly around the wheel using CSS transforms.
Animate the cabins so they remain upright as the Ferris wheel rotates. This involves using the transform property to counter-rotate the cabins.
Enhancing Visual Appeal:

Customize the design with colors, shadows, and other CSS effects to enhance the visual appeal of the Ferris wheel.
Consider adding a background that complements the Ferris wheel, such as a sky or a fairground scene.
Getting Started
1. HTML Structure:
Begin by creating the basic HTML structure for the Ferris wheel. Use a div element for the wheel and additional div or span elements for the cabins and spokes.
Structure your HTML to reflect the hierarchy of the Ferris wheel and its components.
2. CSS Styling:
Style the Ferris wheel using CSS. Apply border-radius, width, height, and other properties to create the circular shape of the wheel.
Position the cabins and spokes correctly using CSS position and transform properties.
3. Animating the Ferris Wheel:
Use @keyframes to define the rotation of the Ferris wheel. Set up the animation to rotate the wheel 360 degrees.
Apply the animation property to the wheel element, specifying a duration and infinite loop.
4. Animating the Cabins:
Ensure the cabins remain upright as the wheel rotates by applying a counter-rotation using transform within the keyframes.
Fine-tune the animation to achieve a smooth and realistic effect.
Final Touches
After completing the basic animation, review your project to ensure everything works as expected. Test the animation in different browsers to ensure compatibility and smooth performance. You may also want to:

Adjust the timing and easing functions to perfect the animation.
Add more visual details, such as shadows, highlights, or additional background elements.
Ensure that the Ferris wheel's animation is smooth and consistent across different screen sizes and devices.
Conclusion
By building a Ferris wheel using CSS animations, you'll gain hands-on experience with key CSS properties and techniques, including @keyframes, transform, and animation. This project is a fun and engaging way to deepen your understanding of CSS animations and how they can be used to create dynamic, interactive web designs.
